Groups Act As Watchers
======================

Yet another plugin that allows groups to be added as watchers. This plugin aims
to be very simple and does not require any additional views/menus/etc. After
installing this plugin, your groups will show up in the normal watchers menus,
and can be added as watchers for new issues both in the interface and API.
